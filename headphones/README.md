ALX HTML & CSS Project: Headphones Landing Page

Overview

This project is a fully-functional, responsive website implemented from scratch for the "Headphones" design, as per the specifications from the ALX HTML/CSS curriculum. The goal was to create an attractive, accessible, and mobile-friendly page using only HTML and CSS, with a final interactive version incorporating JavaScript for mobile navigation.

Features:

Responsive layout with a mobile-first approach.

Interactive links and hover states.

A hero/header section, "What we do...", "Our results", "Contact us" sections, and a fully styled footer.

Pure HTML/CSS pentagon shapes in the "Our results" section.

Simple JavaScript for a mobile-friendly "Hamburger Menu."

Smooth animations for "What we do..." and "Our results" sections.
